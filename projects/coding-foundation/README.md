# hiii :)
## Welcome to my first coding exercise.

This is how it works:

Enter a _number_ in the box and you'll get the *exact same number* of squares below.

What I did is basically imitating __@leoneckert's__ gif. Click [here](https://github.com/leoneckert/abc-f20/tree/master/coding-foundation) to see his tutorial.

Also shoutout to myself for all the coding at **Comm Lab** last semester as reference right now.

Have fun! :smiley: ~~(at least I had lol)~~
