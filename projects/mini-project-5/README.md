Using background script and chrome.tabs API, this extension is designed as a simulation game. In this game, the user will see tabs in their window as pets that have feelings. Different message will show on popup window when performing different operations to the tabs. This can be a gift for users for a little relexation.

Version 1.0 includes two interactions.

If we activate a tab (for example, we click tab "NYU Shanghai"):
