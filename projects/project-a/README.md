## Quick Access
Click [here](https://yuhangzheng94.github.io/abc-student-repo/projects/project-a/) to see the rendered version of the project (Chrome recommended).

## Description
This project tries to explore different facets of water through experimenting with pop-up windows.

The home page consists of three buttons, each representing a facet of water:

After clicking the "ripple" button, a window would pop up as a pond. The user can click anywhere within the window and at that position another pop-up window representing a ripple would be generated, expands its width and height and finally disappears. This effect is intended to explore the surface of water through the perspective of from above.

After clicking the "drip" button, three windows would pop up: a still one on top of screen that contains an image of tap, a blue one lying at the bottom of the screen as a tank, gaining height over time, and a moving one with an image of water drop. This effects is trying to play with the gravity of water.

After clicking the "wave" button, a window with background color of yellow would show on top of screen as the beach. When the user move the mouse over that window, a blue window as wave would generate from the bottom of the screen and become higher and higher as if it is hitting the shore. Once the two windows meet, another window of sea spray would pop up. This effect is to explore the water as in a sea from above.

## Reflections

### Challenges
1. Too many pop-up windows cause a noticeable delay in time and ruin the final effects.
2. for some reason, some pop-up window would take up full screen all of a sudden. (that also happens when I view some of others' projects)

### Compromises
Due to time limit, I did not finalize the image size and adjust timeouts or intervals to its best effect.

### Shortcomings
1. The style between three experiments with water is inconsistent,
2. The images are not in appropriate size,
3. the "ripple" one should be colored so the intention would be more clear, and
4. more qualities of water as well as creative use of HTML/CSS/JavaScript should be explored, such as Web Audio API. (credit to Leon, Yufeng and Samantha)
