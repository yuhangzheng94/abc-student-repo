# Reading Response #4

## Jim, Alice Ming Wai. "The Different Worlds of Cao Fei"

## Driscoll, Megan. "Now You're in my Computer: Performing in the Network's Theater of Visibility"

I am fascinated by the multiple layers on top of each other in Cao Fei’s project, _RMB City_ (2007-2011), in terms of spatiality. First of all, in parallel with the physical space, partly driven by her resistance to the Western gaze, Cao Fei created a three-dimensional cyberspace, where the most iconic landmarks of modern China through its rapid urbanization were identified, reshaped and assembled. In the meanwhile, this project based on space itself serves as an experimental space to exhibit other art projects and even host events.

And the third layer of Cao’s RMB City lies in the idea that once it opens to the public, it is no longer Cao’s own space; users are also empowered to create and modify their own space within the pace of the RMB City. Through the avatar, one is enabled to project their inner self (within a physical body) onto the virtual world, and is engaged to interact with the City itself and others in that space. Beyond that, the RMB City manages to extend its existence and impact to the physical world.

Driscoll’s essay guides us to inquiry into digital identities through the living and performing in the network of hypervisibility. While the RMB City reflects a more external world, Eva and Franco Matte reveal their internal world through _Life Sharing_ (2001-2003). They share the digital space as a platform to trace their “daily lives and interpersonal relations” with the public. With developing web technology and emerging social media later, _Scandalishious_ and _Dark Content_ certainly add a performative flavour to the manifestation of digital identities and some participatory element to viewers’ web experience.

Another moment that I would like to respond to is the spontaneous approach Cao Fei adopted during her making of the machinima _i-Mirror_ (2007). Both articles lead to this question: How much power should the performer(s) and the spectators have over the network’s theater, and over each other?
