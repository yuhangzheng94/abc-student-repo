# Reading Response #5

### [Prompt, deleted after writing]
How do relationships*, intimacy, and interpersonal connections exist online?

Think of gestures, behaviours, norms, etiquettes, interactions that replace equivalents in the "real world" or ones that emerged and exist uniquely online.

Read both readings, take notes and write a short response (200-300). If available, add further associations that come to your mind while reading/thinking.

*you may discuss ANY kind of relationship (not just romantic).
