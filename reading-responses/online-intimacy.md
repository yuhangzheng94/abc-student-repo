# Reading Response #3

One takeaway is that our physical and virtual bodies are not separate or independent. They are just different representations of who we are. That partly explains that in this new era, where the development of Web 2.0 requires authenticity instead of anonymity twenty years ago, online presence is more of a new burden than an escape from the real world.
Ann Hirsch's _Playground_ (2013), where the author indicates a possible fear that physically meeting each other would sabotage the couple's online intimacy, is a great example of how the digital era alters our ways of being and provides a new context and new reality of human interaction.

In the opening of "In the Name of Love: Arguments for a Slow Internet", a scenario of a modern breakup is introduced. Evans observes some extra closure we need than decades ago: untagging and unfriending on social media. And such erasure often turns out incomplete, which gives us lasting pain. This echoes Evans’ argument that we are “the sum of our recorded experience”. We do not just push our experiences to these digital representations; we also pull from the traces ourselves and others leave online. It is time we stop seeing our physical existences and in-person interactions as norms and the only reality. However we may also be cautious about our digital representations. In the usual 24/7 online performance, how much do we fall into pursuing perfect yet contrived images of being surrounded by loved ones rather than genuinely tell our stories that are worth recording?
