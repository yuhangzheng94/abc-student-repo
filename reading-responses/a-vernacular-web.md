## Olia Lialina, “A Vernacular Web”

__A Bigger Picture:__

Looking back on Lialina’s inquiry into “a vernacular web”, I see two agents in the development of web design – web/graphic designers as “professionals” versus individual users as “amateurs”. After reading the essays, one questions occur to me: Who has the say alongside the course of web design? My answer leans towards “the amateurs”: ordinary users are to the web as people are to their nation; it is the first users that contribute to the prosperity of today’s web design.

A personal webpage has some characteristics that a corporate website cannot compare with. The first is the personality a personal web page can reveal. While web designers obey some “standard” design code in their construction of websites, individual users create a space where they can freely express themselves in an aesthetic and artistic way. Because of this personality, it also builds a sense of accessibility. One traditional element I notice introduced in the first part of the essay is the “Mail Me” button. Like nowadays blogs, from this button I see the desire of a physical body to have genuine conversation and personal interaction with viewers (also users) through the virtual body.

__Some Trivial Thoughts:__

The rainbow divider looks like a progress bar.

Is my gallery room considered a home page?

“Transfluency”: the look of a glass reminds me of Apple’s frosted glass layers since iOS 7.

“Glossy round edged style” I guess they don’t design like that anymore. As far as I know, flat web design is popular?
