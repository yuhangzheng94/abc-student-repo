## Elvia Wilk, *High Infidelity*

While some hold the view that online communications would create a friend environment that consists less of systematic discrimination because the identity markers of a virtual body do not have to align with those of the physical body, I argue **the opposite**. Although the anonymity veils the existence of the physical body and may empower users with their disguised virtual identities, it also covers up all negativities one normally holds back in the presence of their physical body. For example, on Weibo and Twitter there are so many rantings that we usually do not hear from people around us in daily life.

The artwork *My Boyfriend Came Back from the War* reminds me of the interactive story I did in Communications Lab last semester. Similar to Lialina’s artwork who mainly interact with users by click and have a narrative with plots of tree structures but converging at the end, my project was inspired by a video game called *Fate/Stay Night*, where the player makes decisions leading to three major endings.

Another interesting notion about relations between the virtual body and the physical one is “virtual violence”. The ranting one receives in their virtual identity may reflect badly in their physical existence, which indicates some connections between virtual and physical world: multiple virtual identities can be seen as projections from the physical body.

There are other passages that inspire me a lot. For example, I usually perceive the virtual environment as “unreal” place of imagination, but the essay suggested it better regarded as alternative form of reality other than the physical one. Besides, Kristen Lucas’s work in some way changed my way of thinking about my future projects: the visual result may appear the same; something behind it can be refreshing every moment. Sometimes the point is not what is presented and perceived in viewers’ eyes but what it actually means.
