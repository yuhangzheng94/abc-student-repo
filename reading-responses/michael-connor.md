## Michael Connor, "I Have Nothing to Say and I’m Saying It: Net Art’s Corporate Turns"

The project of my choice is [Samsung (1999)](https://anthology.rhizome.org/samsung) by Young-hae Chang Heavy Industries.

The statement "context is king" really deepens my understanding of art expression. Nowadays we are situated in an era where it is possible for everyone to be a content creator themselves. While realizing the importance of "content is king", we often overlook the statement "context is king". If we see context as a framework within which we can create anything, it is more likely that we will not limit our ideas and thoughts in the box but push back the boundaries of art expression (I think I'll talk about this again when discussing "archive").

Okay, let's get back to net art itself. Before the internet’s "corporate turn", the network was seen as "both material and a site of encounter". The focus is on net as emerging media itself: JODI’s _Automatic Rain_ (1995) takes advantage of slow processing and long delay of that time to create an aesthetic sense of raining; the protests make use of the net as a tool for the revolution to show their attitudes (by the way some government use the similar strategy to attack websites like GitHub, not cool).

After "corporate turn", works of net art seem to surround the commercial context. The corporate element is the theme, or as the material. Selling blackness on eBay is a good example of using commercial context as a platform, as the canvas. Different from that, _Samsung_ actually does both. It uses Flash (let's not forget it is from Adobe and that, my friend, is a corporate) as a tool, talks about one of the largest Chaebol, Samsung in South Korea, and even its style gives off a vibe of "corporate video": the font, how they pop up, how the sound goes with the caption in a too harmonious way... (it reminds me of Apple ads to be honest)

The quote "work that contains a relatively strong political and social intent, but is clothed […] in ironic ambiguity" actually comes from YHCHI. The relatively strong political and social intent no doubt points to too strong the impact of Chaebol, especially Samsung, exert in Korean people's daily life. (And remind me to finish _Parasite_, it is about Charbol and it is great). I believe the ambiguity lies in the attitude towards Samsung, the real Chaebol and its existence, not just the concept YHCHI are obsessed with in their work.

According to Faucault, "the archive is first the law of what can be said." As is already said in the essay, in terms of browser performance, the project of _Samsung_ coexists with Adobe Flash player and it cannot be said directly through Chrome after this December. In terms of content, I guess the

Despite "corporate turn", I think what is constant is the expression itself, the resolution against institutional power, and the pursuit of self identification.
